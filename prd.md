# **Project Requirements Document: Financial Assistant Application**

The following table outlines the functional requirements focusing on intelligent query routing and knowledge management.

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| FR001 | Intelligent Query Routing | As a user, I want the assistant to automatically determine the best tool to answer my question. | The system should analyze user queries and intelligently select the appropriate tool (database, Yahoo Finance, Chroma RAG) without requiring explicit tool selection from the user. |
| FR002 | Personal Financial Data Access | As a user, I want to ask natural language questions about my financial data. | The system should automatically use database tools when queries relate to personal transactions, portfolio, or user information, filtering results by user email. |
| FR003 | Market Data Retrieval | As a user, I want to get real-time financial market information by simply asking questions. | The system should detect queries about current stock prices or market data and automatically use Yahoo Finance tools to retrieve the information. |
| FR004 | Financial Knowledge Q&A | As a user, I want to ask general financial advice questions in natural language. | The system should route knowledge-based questions to the RAG system that retrieves information from the Chroma vector database. |
| FR005 | Contextual Conversations | As a user, I want the system to maintain context across multiple questions. | The system should use conversation history to provide contextually relevant answers, regardless of which tool is being used to retrieve information. |
| FR006 | Financial Calculations | As a user, I want to perform financial calculations without specifying which tool to use. | The system should detect calculation requests and automatically use the Python REPL tool for financial computations. |
| FR007 | Admin Knowledge Management | As an admin, I want to upload text files to expand the system's financial knowledge. | The admin interface should allow file uploads that are automatically processed and injected into the Chroma vector database. |
| FR008 | Direct Knowledge Input | As an admin, I want to directly input financial knowledge snippets. | The admin interface should provide a text input area for adding knowledge directly to the Chroma database with appropriate metadata. |
| FR009 | Knowledge Base Reset | As an admin, I want to reset or update the knowledge base as needed. | The admin interface should provide functionality to reset the knowledge base and add default financial knowledge. |
| FR010 | Multi-source Response Generation | As a user, I want comprehensive answers that may require data from multiple sources. | The system should be able to combine information from different tools (database, Yahoo Finance, RAG) to generate complete and informative responses. |
